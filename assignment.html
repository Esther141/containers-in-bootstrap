        <h2>WHAT ABOUT IT</h2>
        <P>Elaeis guineensis is a species of palm commonly just called oil palm but also sometimes African oil palm or macaw-fat.[3] The first Western person to describe it and bring back seeds was the French naturalist Micheal Anderson.<br> African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis
            It is native to west and southwest Africa, specifically the area between Angola and The Gambia; the species name, guineensis, refers to the name for the area called Guinea, and not the modern country Guinea now bearing that name. The species is also now naturalised in Madagascar, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, Central America, Cambodia, the West Indies, and several islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The closely related American oil palm E. oleifera and a more distantly related palm, Attalea maripa, are also used to produce palm oil.
            
            E. guineensis was domesticated in West Africa along the south-facing Atlantic coast. There is insufficient documentation and as of 2019[5] insufficient research to make any guesses as to when this occurred.[6] Human use of oil palms may date as far back as 5,000 years in Egypt; in the late 1800s, archaeologists discovered palm oil in a tomb at Abydos, Egypt dating back to 3000 BCE.[7]
            
            It is the principal source of palm oil. Oil palms can produce much more oil per unit of land area than most other oil-producing plants (about nine times more than soy and 4.5 times more than rapeseed).[8]
